 a “Quiz Game” would be to create an interactive and engaging web-based game that allows users to test their knowledge on various topics. 
The game should provide a variety of questions, keep track of scores, and offer feedback on the user’s performance. It should have an intuitive 
user interface that is easy to navigate and responsive to different device sizes. If this is a learning project,
another key objective would be to gain experience and practice with web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
