Objective:
You will be creating a full-stack website that uses the student information from a database as input and generates his/her result in PDF format as output which can then be downloaded and shared.

High-Level Approach:
Firstly, we will be understanding the end goal of this project i.e. Result Section.
Thereafter, we move towards the Database part starting from naive queries to optimizing it.
Then, we will jump to the Admin Section for performing various activities that previously were done manually i.e. data addition and modification.
Authentication for admin section will then take place.
Then, we will Club things all together into our system.

Primary goals:
Performing normalization of the database.
Performing various database queries.
Automating the addition and modification of student data.
Implement an authentication system for admin.
Generate the result in PDF format and download it.
