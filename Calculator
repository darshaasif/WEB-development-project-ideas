Objective :
The calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
It could also include more advanced mathematical functions like square root, exponentiation, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.
It should handle errors gracefully. For example, if a user tries to divide by zero, the calculator should display an appropriate error message instead of crashing or displaying incorrect results.

high level approach :
firstly Understand the requirements of the project. What kind of calculator is it going to be? A simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations or a scientific calculator with more advanced functions?

secondly Sketch the user interface of the calculator. It should be user-friendly and intuitive. Plan how the calculator will look on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
